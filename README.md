# Wellspring
Welcome to the Wellspring Info/Wiki!

Wellspring is a hybrid between a trading card game and a turn-based tactics game. Players take turns playing cards from their hands to summon characters and equipment to the battlefield, while simultaneously battling it out on a 10 by 10 grid by strategically moving their units, attacking, and casting spells. 

The last Hero standing wins!

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/QT-1/Wellspring/wiki) for more information about the game and how to play.
